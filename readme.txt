This Pong project is focused on applying reinforcement learning (RL) using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to play the classic Atari game "Pong", where the agent is represented in green color during gameplay.

Description:

- Preprocessing: The game frames are preprocessed by converting them to grayscale, resizing to 84x84 pixels, and normalizing pixel values. This simplifies the input for the model and makes training more efficient.

- Model Architecture: The agent is modeled using a neural network with three fully connected layers. The input is the flattened game screen (84x84 pixels), and the output is the action space of the game. The network predicts Q-values for each possible action.

- Replay Buffer: A replay buffer stores experiences (state, action, reward, next_state, and done flag) for training. The agent samples experiences from this buffer to train, which helps in breaking the correlation between consecutive frames and improves learning stability.

- Action Selection (Exploration vs Exploitation): An epsilon-greedy strategy is used to balance exploration and exploitation. Early in training, the agent takes random actions (high exploration), and as training progresses, it relies more on the model's predictions (exploitation).

- Training: After each action, the agent learns by minimizing the difference between predicted Q-values and the target Q-values, which are calculated using a combination of immediate rewards and discounted future rewards (using the gamma factor).

- Training Loop: For each episode, the agent plays the game until the game ends. The agent collects rewards and stores transitions in the replay buffer. Then, it samples from the buffer and updates the DQN model using the Adam optimizer.

- Agent's Gameplay: During the gameplay, the agent is visually represented by a green-colored paddle. The agent interacts with the game environment, making decisions based on the state of the game to maximize its total reward.

The objective is for the green agent to improve its gameplay over time by learning which actions lead to higher rewards in the game of Pong.
